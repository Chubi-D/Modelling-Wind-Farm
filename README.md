## 🌬️ Wind Energy Simulation – Montreal Case Study

This project simulates wind power generation using real hourly weather data from Montreal. Using the `windpowerlib` library, I modeled the performance of the **Enercon E48/800** wind turbine to estimate its energy output.

### 🔧 Key Features:
- 📊 Preprocessed real weather data (wind speed, temperature, etc.)
- ⚙️ Selected and configured a realistic wind turbine model
- 🔄 Simulated energy yield using the `ModelChain` method
- 📈 Visualized power output trends to assess viability

This project showcases my skills in renewable energy modeling, time-series analysis, and Python-based simulation workflows.
